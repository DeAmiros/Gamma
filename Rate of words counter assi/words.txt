The experiment shows us that the Holocaust wasn't just about "bad" people doing evil things. Instead, it shows how normal people can be influenced by doing horrible things. At the start, Ben Rossâ€™s students appear to be normal, but then they suddenly change. Take Robert Billings for example, he used to be kind of an outsider, but once he joined The Wave, he felt much more confident and accepted, even though he stopped thinking for himself. This shows exactly how normal people in Nazi Germany got pulled into doing terrible actions just because everyone else was also doing it. Basically, it proves how intense peer pressure and authority can be.
